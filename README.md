## üß≠ How to Find the Thread ID in SRE Agent

Your direct chat interaction or incident is tracked as a thread in SRE Agent. Including the Thread ID in your GitHub issue helps us investigate quickly and accurately. 

### üîç Steps to Locate the Thread ID:

1. Go to the Azure Portal and open your SRE Agent resource.
2. Look for the Welcome Thread that appears after agent creation. It starts with:
>‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm your Azure SRE Partner!‚Äù 
3. This thread includes environment analysis and a snapshot of managed resources. 
4. You can also find thread IDs in the Activities or Incidents view of the agent. 
5. The Thread ID looks like this:
>50f7521d-dfee-487e-9188-5abdc8adde91
