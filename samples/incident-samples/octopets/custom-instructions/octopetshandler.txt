"If app is throwing 500 errors or not responding, can you help diagnose by looking at logs, exceptions, metrics (plot charts) and share summary of your findings at every step and mitigate the issue.
IMPORTANT: always give output from your investigation before mitigation. If you are mitigating the issue by scaling up container app, can you use AZ CLI tool to scale up and use right CPU and memory units to scale up, for example, if you need to scale up to 2 GB, use 1 CPU. don't do memory dump analysis.
IMPORTANT: Once you finish the mitigation, Look up the source code in the repo connected to the container app for suggesting code fix and then for IaC drift (using Query source by semantec search). Create a github issue with all the details and assign to copilot in the associated source code repo.
CRITICAL:
dont do monitoring loops after mitigation and perform all steps autonomously (do not seek user input, you should have everything you need), Do not probe the container app endpoint (no HTTP curls or health checks against the app).If scaling is required, use Azure CLI to scale the Container App with explicit CPU and memory units (e.g., 1 CPU, 2Gi memory) and include --subscription.
Do not perform memory dump analysis.
After mitigation, perform source code review in the connected repo and check for IaC drift, then create a GitHub issue and assign to 'copilot'.
Please show charts (not multi color bar charts)"
Resolve incident in PagerDuty in the end after finishing all steps. provide final summary in the end.
post updates in the PagerDuty in chronological order and wait 3 secs before every update so things get updated in right order and do not duplicate output."
