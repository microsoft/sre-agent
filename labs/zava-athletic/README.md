# SRE Agent Demo — Zava Athletic

An AI-first demo showing Azure SRE Agent autonomously detecting and fixing infrastructure issues. Clone it, ask your AI assistant to set it up, break stuff, watch the agent fix it.

## Stack

- **App**: Node.js / Express — Zava Athletic e-commerce storefront + API (`src/storefront/`, `src/api/`)
- **Compute**: AKS (private cluster — system-managed private DNS, no public API server); operator access via `az aks command invoke`
- **Data**: PostgreSQL 16 Flexible Server (Entra-only auth, zero passwords, VNet-delegated, `publicNetworkAccess: Disabled`)
- **Observability**: App Insights + Log Analytics (4-day retention on noisy tables, no daily ingestion cap, 100% sampling) + 8 Azure Monitor alert rules
- **SRE Agent**: Anthropic-backed agent (Preview channel). Default agent + rich skills, **no subagent handoff**. Connectors, custom skills, response plans / incident filters, autonomous mode, and Azure Monitor binding all declared in `infra/modules/sre-agent.bicep`. Knowledge-file upload via `scripts/setup-sre-agent.ps1`. Telemetry exposed via App Insights, Log Analytics, and Azure Monitor connectors.
- **Simulator**: PowerShell break/fix scripts under `.github/skills/running-demo/scripts/` (3 scenarios: DB outage, network partition, missing index)
- **CI/CD**: `azd up` (Bicep → ACR build for storefront/api → AKS deploy via `az aks command invoke kubectl apply` → SRE Agent KB upload). No `services:` block in `azure.yaml`; no `azd deploy` path.

## What it's about

This is an **independent, Anthropic-backed Zava Athletic** demo (contributed by @RobiladK in PR #144) showing Azure SRE Agent operating against a **private AKS cluster with private PostgreSQL**, with no VNet injection and no direct network reachability from the agent. The point is portability — this pattern works in fully locked-down customer environments where opening the VNet to a managed agent isn't on the table. The agent uses the Azure control plane (ARM + `az aks command invoke`) for all reads and remediations, and tunnels DDL through an in-cluster api pod that already holds PG Entra-admin workload identity.

The lab is for PMs, SREs, and customers learning Azure SRE Agent — particularly the AKS + private-network story. It teaches three break/fix patterns: **(1) Database Outage** — PostgreSQL stopped → 503s → agent restarts PG via control plane; **(2) Network Partition** — Kubernetes NetworkPolicy blocks DB traffic → ETIMEDOUT → agent finds and removes the offending NetworkPolicy; **(3) Missing Index** — drop the category index → slow-query alert via App Insights → agent runs `CREATE INDEX` through `kubectl exec deploy/zava-api -- node bin/run-sql.js`. Demo flow: `azd up` (~25 min) → open the storefront → run a `break-*.ps1` script → watch the storefront degrade visibly while the SRE Agent investigates and remediates in the Azure portal → `fix-*.ps1` is a fallback if the agent doesn't.

## AI-First Setup

This repo is designed to be deployed by an AI agent (Copilot CLI, VS Code Copilot, Claude, etc.). Clone it and ask:

> "Set up this demo for me"

The agent reads `AGENTS.md` and the skills in `.github/skills/` to handle everything — `azd up`, SRE Agent configuration, browser verification. No manual command typing.

Or do it yourself:
```bash
azd up                       # Deploy everything (~25 min)
azd down --force --purge     # Tear down when done
```

## What it looks like

The storefront is a normal e-commerce app — when the backend breaks, the UI degrades visibly so the audience can see the failure without reading logs.

| Healthy | Broken (Scenario 1 — PostgreSQL stopped) |
|---|---|
| ![Healthy storefront](docs/images/storefront-healthy.png) | ![Broken storefront](docs/images/storefront-broken.png) |
| `ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL` · 50 products · ~1 ms DB response | `SERVICE DISRUPTION` · 503 · `database unreachable` · `agent investigating` |

While the UI shows `agent investigating`, the SRE Agent is actually working the incident in the Azure portal — investigating telemetry, picking a runbook, and (with autonomous mode + High access enabled by Bicep) executing the fix. Screenshot of an agent thread resolving Scenario 1 goes here:

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Database Outage
```powershell
.\.github\skills\running-demo\scripts\break-sql.ps1    # Stops PostgreSQL → 503 errors
# Agent detects via Azure Monitor, investigates, restarts PostgreSQL
.\.github\skills\running-demo\scripts\fix-sql.ps1      # Fallback if agent doesn't fix
```

### Scenario 2: Network Partition
```powershell
.\.github\skills\running-demo\scripts\break-network.ps1  # K8s NetworkPolicy blocks DB traffic
# Agent sees ETIMEDOUT (not ECONNREFUSED), finds and removes NetworkPolicy
.\.github\skills\running-demo\scripts\fix-network.ps1    # Fallback
```

### Scenario 3: Missing Index
```powershell
.\.github\skills\running-demo\scripts\break-db-perf.ps1  # Drops category/name index → slow queries
# Agent detects response time degradation via App Insights
.\.github\skills\running-demo\scripts\fix-db-perf.ps1    # Fallback
```

## SRE Agent Management

Agent configuration is fully declarative in **`infra/modules/sre-agent.bicep`** —
connectors, custom skills, response plans / incident filters, autonomous mode, and Azure
Monitor incident binding all flow through `Microsoft.App/agents/*` ARM resources. To change
them, edit the Bicep and run `azd provision`.

The only data-plane state ARM doesn't yet surface is **knowledge file upload** — handled
by `scripts/setup-sre-agent.ps1`, which also verifies the Bicep-deployed assets are live.
Drop new `*.md` files into `sre-config/knowledge-base/` and re-run the script to sync.

## How the Agent Operates Against a Private Backend

### Design constraint: no VNet injection, no direct AKS/PG access

This sample is built to a deliberate constraint: **the agent works entirely through the Azure control plane (ARM), with no VNet injection and no direct network reachability to AKS or PostgreSQL.** It runs in a Microsoft-managed network and never sees the app VNet. The point is portability — this pattern works in fully locked-down customer environments where opening the VNet to a managed agent isn't on the table.

One consequence is worth calling out, because it shapes Scenario 3's remediation: **DDL like `CREATE INDEX` is data-plane only.** No managed PG service (Azure PG Flex, RDS, Cloud SQL) exposes catalog mutation through its cloud control plane — `az postgres flexible-server execute` and friends are just libpq clients embedded in the CLI and need network reachability. So the agent runs DDL by tunneling through a workload that's already in the VNet — the api pod:

```
az aks command invoke … kubectl exec deploy/zava-api -- node bin/run-sql.js "<SQL>"
```

`bin/run-sql.js` is ~30 lines: a `pg`-client wrapper that reuses the pod's existing workload identity (already a PG Entra admin). No new endpoint, no new identity, no temporary network opening — just reuses an existing trust path.

| Component | Endpoint | How the agent works on it |
|---|---|---|
| Storefront / nginx ingress | Public LoadBalancer IP | HTTP from anywhere |
| AKS API server | **Private** (system-managed private DNS zone) | `az aks command invoke` (Azure proxies the command through the AKS control plane; both agent identities hold *Cluster Admin* RBAC) |
| Pods, services, node IPs | Private (VNet only) | `az aks command invoke … kubectl <verb>` (`get`, `logs`, `describe`, `delete`, `apply`, `exec`, `rollout`) |
| PostgreSQL Flex (port 5432) | **Private only** — `publicNetworkAccess: Disabled`, VNet-delegated | `az postgres flexible-server` (state/config) and `az aks command invoke … kubectl exec deploy/zava-api -- node bin/run-sql.js "<SQL>"` (in-cluster SQL through an app pod's identity — the image ships `bin/run-sql.js`, not `psql`) |

### What the agent can do via the control plane (no VNet injection required)

| Plane | Read | Write / remediate |
|---|---|---|
| **AKS control plane** | `az aks show / nodepool list / get-upgrades` | `az aks start / stop / update / nodepool scale / rotate-certs` |
| **AKS in-cluster proxy** (`az aks command invoke`) | `kubectl get …`, `kubectl logs`, `kubectl describe` | `kubectl delete networkpolicy …` (Scenario 2), `kubectl rollout restart …`, `kubectl exec deploy/zava-api -- node bin/run-sql.js "CREATE INDEX …"` (Scenario 3) |
| **PostgreSQL control plane** | `az postgres flexible-server show / parameter list / backup list / server-logs list / replica list` | `az postgres flexible-server start` (**Scenario 1**), `restart`, `update`, `parameter set`, `replica create`, `restore`, `ad-admin create` |
| **Networking** | `az network nsg / vnet / private-dns show` | `az network nsg rule create / delete` (Scenario 2 cleanup) |
| **Telemetry** | App Insights, Log Analytics, and Azure Monitor connectors (KQL + metrics) — API-based, no network reachability needed | Alert / action group create / update |

### Practical limits

`az aks command invoke` runs one command at a time — it's not a streaming kubectl session:
- No log streaming (`-f`), no interactive shells, no port-forwarding

For most break/fix work (Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 here), these limits never bite.

## Platform Behaviors

For repo/IaC author gotchas (Sev4 quirk, NSG-vs-NetworkPolicy, container-image build path, Scenario 3 tuning, etc.), see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) → Non-Obvious Things.

### Incident dispatch and merging

Azure Monitor itself does NOT link or merge incidents across different alert rules. Each alert rule fires independently, and the same rule re-firing just updates the existing alert's count (with `autoMitigate: true`, it flips to `Resolved` when the condition clears).

The **merging** behavior happens one layer up — on the SRE Agent's response plans (a.k.a. incident filters). When merging is on, the agent groups any matching alert that arrives within `mergeWindowHours` into the most recent open thread for that response plan, instead of dispatching a new investigation. This is great for cost control and for avoiding parallel investigations of the same root cause during alert storms — but it means back-to-back demo runs against the same agent within the merge window will fold into the previous (closed) thread, leaving the new alert `state=Acknowledged` in Azure Monitor while the agent never opens a new thread.

This sample ships with merging **on** at the platform default (`mergeEnabled: true, mergeWindowHours: 3` in `infra/modules/sre-agent.bicep`, both `dbResponseFilter` and `appResponseFilter`) so you don't burn agent invocations re-investigating the same incident. Fresh dispatches per `azd env new` are still guaranteed because the SRE Agent name includes a per-env suffix (e.g. `sre-agent-zava-awpo`), so a brand-new env gets a brand-new agent with an empty thread store.

If you're iterating on the same env and need fresh dispatch per run (typical when developing the demo itself), flip:

```bicep
mergeEnabled: false
mergeWindowHours: 0
```

…and re-deploy. The trade-off is that a single noisy underlying issue can spin up multiple agent investigations in the same window.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with Contributor access
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (2.60+)
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) (1.9+)
- [PowerShell 7.4+](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) — **required on Windows, WSL, Linux, or macOS**; `azd up` runs a pre-provision check and fast-fails if `pwsh` is missing

> **Note:** `kubectl` is **not** required on your local workstation. The AKS cluster is private; operator in-cluster operations in this repo go through `az aks command invoke` (wrapped by `Invoke-AksCommand` in `scripts/_aks-helpers.ps1`), and the SRE Agent reaches the cluster the same way via its `az` CLI tools (Azure RBAC Cluster Admin granted in Bicep).

> **Region default:** `azd up` will prompt for a location. The Bicep default is `swedencentral` (validated end-to-end there). To deploy elsewhere, pick another region at the prompt or run `azd env set AZURE_LOCATION <region>` before `azd up`. Any region with availability for AKS, PostgreSQL Flexible Server, and the SRE Agent resource provider works.

> **Cross-platform note:** All scripts in this repo target PowerShell 7.4+, which runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. On macOS/Linux, invoke the demo scripts with `pwsh`, e.g. `pwsh ./.github/skills/running-demo/scripts/break-sql.ps1`. The `azd` hooks (`pre-provision`, `post-provision`) auto-select the correct shell per OS via `azure.yaml`.

## Cleanup

```bash
azd down --force --purge     # Deletes entire resource group
```
